 Module 1:
 
 HOME PAGE PHASE:
 
 At first we started by developing a home page for User Registration. In this page we 
have picture for our app and one simple button to enter into an app. While entering into 
the app we will have two buttons which is login and register. If a user is new to this app, 
first they have to register in this app by giving their details and after successful
 registration only they can enter into the app. If a user is already a user to this app, then 
they can directly enter into the app by just logging into this app. This two things are the 
basic things to work in this app and these two buttons will lead us to all other pages in 
this app. In this both login and register page, we will option for us to choose either we 
are food provider or we are food needer. 

Module 2: 

FORMS PHASE:

 In this phase we are concentrating in creating the various forms in different ways to 
work into this app and also help us to move into other various pages. At first we will 
create the form for new user, from where we get various information about the user such 
as their Email, Password, Mobile no and so on. Next we will create the form for already 
user from where they can log in by providing their registered mail id and their password. 
Simultaneously while we are getting the information from the users we also store that 
information in databases by providing the database connectivity to this app. Whatever 
the actions performing in this app we are maintaining the database and the information 
can be viewed at any time. 



Module 3: 

FOOD PROVIDER PHASE: 

Nowadays, the No.of.deaths due to hungry is the most. In order to avoid that we are 
developing this app to help whatever we can do for them. In this app the food providers 
are those who have excess food in their houses, parties, hotels and so on. 12 The food 
providers can register at any time whenever they can provide the food. Once registered 
into this app they need not to register again and also they just need to login alone. The 
food providers also have to fill the form like how much food they have, when they 
prepared that food, how much distance that food is available and so on. 

Module 4:

 FOOD NEEDER PHASE:
 
 In this phase, we will get the information about the food needer by providing the form. 
The food needer persons are those really need the food which will fade away their 
hungry. After log in into this app the food needers can view the post page which is 
posted by the food provider. By viewing the information the food needers can directly 
contact the food provider by making the calls. If the needer is very near from the 
provider they can easily get the food by walk distance otherwise the food needer is far 
away from the provider, the food provider will trace the food needer where they are by 
using the Google maps to locate their location easily and the food providers will provide 
the food to the needer.
